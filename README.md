## News
- 8-class emotion recognition model with iterative fine-tuning from emotion2vec has been released in [modelscope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/iic/emotion2vec_base_finetuned/summary) and [FunASR](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR/tree/main/examples/industrial_data_pretraining/emotion2vec).  
- emotion2vec has been integrated into [modelscope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/iic/emotion2vec_base/summary) and [FunASR](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR/tree/main/examples/industrial_data_pretraining/emotion2vec).  
- We release the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15185), and create a [WeChat group](./src/Wechat.jpg) for emotion2vec. 
- We release code, checkpoints, and extracted features for emotion2vec. 

## Guides

emotion2vec is the first universal speech emotion representation model. Through self-supervised pre-training, emotion2vec has the ability to extract emotion representation across different tasks, languages, and scenarios.

## Performance
### Performance on IEMOCAP
emotion2vec achieves SOTA with only linear layers on the mainstream IEMOCAP dataset. Refer to the paper for more details.

### Performance on other languages
emotion2vec achieves SOTA compared with SOTA SSL models on multiple languages (Mandarin, French, German, Italian, etc.). Refer to the paper for more details.

### Performance on other speech emotion tasks
Refer to the paper for more details.

## Visualization
UMAP visualizations of learned features on the IEMOCAP dataset. <span style="color:red;">Red</span> and <span style="color:blue;">Blue</span> tones mean low and high arousal emotional classes, respectively.  Refer to the paper for more details.

## Extract features
### Download extracted features
We provide the extracted features of popular emotion dataset IEMOCAP. The features are extracted from the last layer of emotion2vec. The features are stored in `.npy` format and the sample rate of the extracted features is 50Hz. The utterance-level features are computed by averaging the frame-level features.
- frame-level: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JdQzwDJJEdKZcqSC1TXETvFZ7VpUvLEX/view?usp=sharing) | [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FtCwhUwhONaeEos4nLYFWw?pwd=zb3p) (password: zb3p)
- utterance-level: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jJVfoEKC8yjwj39F__8jIQayd5PBO0WD/view?usp=sharing) | [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AsJHacD6a5h27YJiCSee4w?pwd=qu3u) (password: qu3u)

All wav files are extracted from the original dataset for diverse downstream tasks. If want to train with standard 5531 utterances for 4 emotions classification, please refer to the `iemocap_downstream` folder.

### Extract features from your dataset
#### Install from the source code
The minimum environment requirements are `python>=3.8` and `torch>=1.13`. Our testing environments are `python=3.8` and `torch=2.01`.
1. git clone repos.
```bash
pip install fairseq
git clone https://github.com/ddlBoJack/emotion2vec.git
```

2. download emotion2vec checkpoint from:
